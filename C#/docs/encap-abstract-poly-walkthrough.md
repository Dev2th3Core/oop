# Encapsulation, Abstraction & Polymorphism Combined: Code Walkthrough

This guide walks you through the code in `Encap&Abstract&PolyImpl.cs` and `Encap&Abstract&Poly.cs`, showing how encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism work together in a real-world scenario.

## Where to Find the Code
- **Implementation:** `Object-Oriented-Programming/Polymorphism/Encap&Abstract&PolyImpl.cs`
- **Usage/Execution:** `Object-Oriented-Programming/Polymorphism/Encap&Abstract&Poly.cs`

## What This Example Demonstrates
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields, public properties, and validation for employee data
- **Abstraction:** Abstract base class (`Employee`) and abstract method (`CalculatePay()`)
- **Polymorphism:**
  - Method overriding and overloading in derived classes
  - Using base class references to call overridden methods (dynamic/runtime polymorphism)
  - Using derived class references to access overloaded methods (compile-time polymorphism)

## Key Concepts in the Code
- **Encapsulation:**
  - All fields (like `_id`, `_name`, `_salary`) are private
  - Public properties (`EmployeeId`, `EmployeeName`, `Salary`, etc.) provide controlled access and validation
- **Abstraction:**
  - The `Employee` class is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly
  - It defines an abstract method `CalculatePay()` that must be implemented by derived classes
- **Polymorphism:**
  - `PermanentEmployee` and `ContractEmployee` both inherit from `Employee` and implement their own versions of `CalculatePay()`
  - Both also provide overloaded versions of `CalculatePay()` with different parameters
  - The code demonstrates calling these methods using both base and derived class references

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Abstract Employee Class (with Encapsulation)
- Private fields: `_id`, `_name`, `_salary`, etc.
- Public properties with validation: `EmployeeId`, `EmployeeName`, `Salary`, etc.
- Abstract method: `CalculatePay()`
- Concrete method: `Display()`

### 2. PermanentEmployee and ContractEmployee
- Both inherit from `Employee`
- Each implements `CalculatePay()` differently (method overriding)
- Each provides overloaded `CalculatePay()` methods (method overloading)
- Each uses the encapsulated properties from the base class

### 3. Usage Example
- In `Encap&Abstract&Poly.cs`, you create and use both types of employees
- Demonstrates:
  - Base class reference to derived class object (dynamic polymorphism)
  - Derived class reference to access overloaded methods (compile-time polymorphism)
- Shows how you can add new employee types or overloads with minimal changes to existing code

## Why This Matters
- This pattern is common in real-world applications
- It keeps your code flexible, maintainable, and easy to extend
- You can add new employee types or pay calculation logic with minimal changes
- Demonstrates the power of combining all three OOP pillars

## Next Steps
- Try modifying the code to add new employee types or new overloads
- Experiment with adding interfaces for benefits or other features
- See how these concepts make your codebase more robust and adaptable

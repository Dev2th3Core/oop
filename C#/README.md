# Object-Oriented Programming in C# - A Beginner's Guide

This project is designed to help beginners understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through practical examples in C#. The project takes a step-by-step approach, starting from basic concepts and gradually building up to more complex implementations.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates OOP concepts through practical examples, making it easier for beginners to understand and implement these concepts in their own projects. Each concept is explained with clear examples and real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this OOP learning project, you should have:
- Basic understanding of C# syntax and language fundamentals
- Familiarity with:
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Control structures (if/else, loops)
  - Methods and parameters
  - Basic class and object syntax
  - Using Visual Studio or VS Code for C# development

This project focuses on OOP concepts and patterns rather than basic C# syntax. If you need to brush up on C# basics, consider reviewing the [official C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) first.

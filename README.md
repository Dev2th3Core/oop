# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Learning Project

This project is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts across multiple programming languages.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Provide clear, practical, and modern examples of OOP concepts (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.) in various languages.
- **Audience:** Beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand and apply OOP in real-world scenarios.

## Supported Languages
- **C#** (current):
  - Step-by-step documentation, code walkthroughs, and practice exercises.
  - See the [`C#`](./C#) folder for all C#-related docs and code.
- **Other Languages:**
  - Support for additional languages (such as Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.) is planned for the future.
  - Each language will have its own top-level folder (e.g., `Java/`, `Python/`).

## How to Navigate
- Go to the folder for your preferred language (currently only `C#` is available).
- Inside each language folder, you'll find:
  - `docs/` — Guided documentation and learning path
  - `Object-Oriented-Programming/` — Code implementations for each OOP concept

## Contributing
We welcome contributions in any language!
- To add a new language, create a new folder at the root (e.g., `Java/`, `Python/`).
- Follow the structure used in the `C#` folder for documentation and code organization.
- See the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Roadmap
- [x] C# OOP documentation and code
- [ ] Add support for Java
- [ ] Add support for Python
- [ ] Add support for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Community contributions for other languages
